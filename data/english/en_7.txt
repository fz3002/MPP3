Nazareth are a Scottish hard rock band formed in Dunfermline in 1968 that had many hit singles and albums in Canada, the United Kingdom, and a number of other European countries beginning in the early 1970s. The breadth of their popularity expanded internationally, including in the United States, with their 1975 album Hair of the Dog, which featured their hits "Hair of the Dog" and a cover of the ballad "Love Hurts".[3][4][5] They have continued to record and tour internationally for more than 50 years.
Career

Nazareth formed in December 1968 in Dunfermline, Scotland, from the remaining members of semi-professional local group the Shadettes (formed in 1961) by vocalist Dan McCafferty, guitarist Manny Charlton, bassist Pete Agnew, and drummer Darrell Sweet.[6] They were inspired by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.[7] Nazareth took their name from Nazareth, Pennsylvania, which is cited in the first line of the Band's classic song "The Weight" ("I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' about half past dead...").[6]

The band moved to London, England in 1970 and released their self titled debut album in 1971.[6] After getting some attention with their second album Exercises, released in 1972, Nazareth supported Deep Purple on tour, and issued the Roger Glover-produced Razamanaz, in early 1973.[6] This collection spawned two UK Top Ten hits, "Broken Down Angel" and "Bad Bad Boy".[6] This was followed by Loud 'N' Proud in late 1973, which contained another hit with a cover of Joni Mitchell's song "This Flight Tonight".[6] Then came another album Rampant, in 1974, that was equally successful although its only single, "Shanghai'd in Shanghai", narrowly missed the British Top 40.[4] The non-album cover of Tomorrow's "My White Bicycle" was a UK Top 20 entry in 1975.[6]

Hair of the Dog, released in April 1975, was produced by Manny Charlton, ending Roger Glover's association with the band.[4] The title track – popularly, though incorrectly, known as "Son of a Bitch" due to its hook lyric – became a staple of 1970s rock radio. The American version of the album included a song originally recorded by the Everly Brothers: the melodic Boudleaux Bryant-penned ballad "Love Hurts". This became a hit in the UK and in the US, where it went platinum. The track became the band's only US Top Ten hit[8] and was also a top 10 hit in nine other countries, reaching number 1 in six of them. The song was on the Norwegian chart for 60 weeks.

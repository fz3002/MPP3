Wong Foon Sien (Chinese: 黃寬先; 7 July 1899 – 31 July 1971), also simply known as Foon Sien, was a Canadian journalist and labour activist. He devoted time to a number of civil and human rights organizations,[1] was one of the early leaders of the Chinese Benevolent Association in Vancouver, and was "perhaps the most influential person" in the city's Chinatown.[2] He was sometimes referred to as the "spokesman for Chinatown",[3] or as "mayor of Chinatown"[4] by Vancouverites, to the resentment of some Chinese Canadians in the community.[5]

Foon Sien sought to end discrimination against Chinese Canadians and other minority groups,[6] and was an ardent activist to grant or recognize their rights, particularly regarding immigration[5] and family reunification.[7]
Early life

He was born Wong Mun Poo (Chinese: 黃文甫) on 7 July 1899 in Guangdong and moved to Cumberland, British Columbia in 1908[8] with his parents.[2] His parents, who had become successful merchants, hoped he would build a career in Imperial China, and had wanted to send him to China for a proper education; he spent time after school reading Four Books and Five Classics when he was 10 years old.[2] Their hopes were dashed when revolutionary Sun Yat-sen visited Cumberland from his exile in the United States on a fund-raising trip in 1911, leaving an impression on Foon Sien, who resolved to study law.[2] After he completed high school, he moved to Vancouver and became one of five Chinese students to enroll at the University of British Columbia (UBC).[2] He became the president of the Chinese Students' Alliance of Canada.[9]

Foon Sien was also a member of the Chinese Canadian Club (Tong-yuen Wui), established in Victoria in 1914.

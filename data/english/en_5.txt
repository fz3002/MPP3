Grivița was ordered in 1880, with the main purpose of enforcing Romanian interests at the newly-established Danube Commission, headquartered in the Romanian port town of Sulina.[3] In 1885-1886, she conducted topographic research off Sulina and the northern half of the Romanian coast.[4] Grivița was brought in Romania by the fleet commander itself.[5]

Between 1886 and 1888, NMS Grivița was commanded by commander Sebastian Eustațiu.[5]

The 1913 Second Balkan War found her on the Danube, where she provided artillery support for the Romanian troops crossing into Bulgaria from Corabia.[6]

When Romania entered the First World War on the side of the Allies in late 1916, she was put at the disposal of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, acting as a liaison ship between the Russian and Romanian forces[7] under the command of Captain Vlădescu Constantin.[8] She was later transferred to the Romanian Danube fleet. In the autumn of 1916, she along with a tug and two barges evacuated the Romanian 37 mm and 57 mm coastal artillery guns from Cinghineaua Island, after the latter ended up 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) behind enemy lines.[9] A few months later, she collided with a Russian ship, but was successfully repaired.[10] After Romania resumed hostilities against the Central Powers in the autumn of 1918, she captured a German cargo ship sailing for Odessa.[11] She was mentioned for the last time in March 1919,[12] her ultimate fate being unknown.[13]
